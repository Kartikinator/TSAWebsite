    <h2 style="text-align:center">About This Club</h2>
    <p>At Dulles High School, the Technology Student Association club strives to enlighten its members in the different
        fields of S.T.E.M. S.T.E.M is a collection of the never-ending study in different fields such as mathematics and
        sciences. Here at Dulles, these fields range from technology research all the way to the different architecture
        and construction of software and hardware in in our everyday electronics. This club does not only utilize skills
        on our knowledge of these everyday items, but also utilizes a feeling of self-consciousness to its members to do
        their best. We think that it isn’t enough to just go into a field and learn and experiment with it, instead we
        strive to break the different boundaries and limitations that each field has in order to provide new discoveries
        and give back to community as well. We believe that anyone, even those who have miniature knowledge of S.T.E.M.
        fields can join our club. According to Albert Einstein,one of the greatest Mathematician and Scientist to live,
        <br><b style="font-size:50px">“It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just it's just that I stay with problems
            longer”</b> <br>we feel
        like anyone who has the passion, determination, and patience can succeed and do well in our club!

    <h4 style="text-align:center">About TSA</h4>
    <p>The Technology Student Association (TSA), formerly known as the American Industrial Arts Student Association
        (AIASA) is a club notoriously known around the United States for helping cultivate students interest in Science,
        Technology, Engineering, and Math fields (S.T.E.M). This nationwide club has a series of different competitions
        such as High School, Middle School, Computer Science, and Themes & Problems, which all help students develop
        strength in their field of interest(s) under the right guidance. This prestigious association not only allows
        students to grow with their S.T.E.M. interest, but also as people. It allows students to go beyond their
        capabilities, do things they never thought were possible, as well as develop their leadership and working
        skills. TSA’s aim is to help students learn and grow as people as well as pursue their field of interest by
        teaching them the importance efficiency, patience, and mainly helping them find themselves. As the world
        progresses day by day, more and more people are needed in the S.T.E.M. industry, the TSA hopes to raise a
        diverse range of people with skills even in lesser, weaker areas as well as those in stronger area to help
        contribute back to our community, for it is our planet and we must take care and advance it!</p>
